# SageMaker Deployment Project

This project provides a recurrent neural network (RNN) built with the `Pytorch` library that implements a simple sentiment analysis tool deployed on AWS SageMaker. The files notebooks and python files provided here result in a simple web app which interacts with the deployed recurrent neural network to perform sentiment analysis on movie reviews. This project assumes some familiarity with SageMaker, the mini-project, Sentiment Analysis using XGBoost, should provide enough background.

This project is a part of the Udacity "Machine Learning Engineering" Nanodegree. Details are found here [README](https://github.com/udacity/sagemaker-deployment/tree/master/README.md).
